# Introduction

Hello! We are two passionate students, recent graduates with Bachelor's degrees in Business and Economics. Despite our academic backgrounds, we have always been drawn to the world of technology and language learning. As non-native French speakers, we've experienced firsthand the challenges of finding suitable reading materials that match our proficiency levels. This personal struggle, combined with our curiosity, led us to participate in a Kaggle competition for our machine learning class.

# The Challenge

The task was presented through a Kaggle competition. The goal was to develop a machine learning model that predicts the difficulty level of French-written texts for English speakers. This model could then be used in a recommendation system to suggest texts, such as recent news articles, that are appropriate for a userâ€™s language level. For instance, presenting a text at the B2 level to a learner at the A1 level would be counterproductive, as it would be too difficult to understand. Conversely, providing texts that are too easy wouldn't contribute much to learning progress. Our mission was to find the perfect balance.

# The Journey Begins

As we delved into this project, we couldn't help but feel a mix of excitement and apprehension. The world of machine learning and natural language processing was relatively new to us, and we felt a bit out of our depth. The technical jargon, complex algorithms, and sophisticated models were intimidating, to say the least. We questioned whether our backgrounds in Business and Economics had prepared us for such a daunting task. Yet, the drive to overcome our language learning challenges and create something impactful kept us going.

We were not very confident at the start, and the fear of failure loomed large. But we decided to face our fears head-on, viewing this as an opportunity to learn and grow. With determination and a shared passion for language learning, we embarked on this journey, ready to tackle each obstacle one step at a time
